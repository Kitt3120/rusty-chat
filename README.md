# rusty-chat

A simple network-wide chat application, consisting of a server and a client side implementation.

# Why?

I just picked up Rust and after going through the "The Rust programming language" book, I wanted to implement something to apply the skills taught by the book. The chat app is multi-threaded and uses Mutexes, Atomic Reference Counting Pointers and Channels to handle memory.
